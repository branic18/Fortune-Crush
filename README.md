# Fortune-Crush 🍒

<p>I built a fun slot machine game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! In this project, players select their bet, which dynamically affects the total amount displayed—adding a thrilling layer of strategy. This project was a great way to deepen my understanding of event handling and user interaction in coding. 🌟</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>With a simple yet engaging interface, I focused on clear visuals and smooth interactions. The JavaScript code handles the betting logic, ensuring players can see how their choices impact their balance in real time.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

  <li>Make it a 3 reel slot for more visual enjoyment</li>
</ul>
